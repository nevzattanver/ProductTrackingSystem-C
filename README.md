# Product Tracking System

This is very simple example of using C and C++ syntax. Some elevator company asked me to develop a little prototype of a product tracking system and I developed this algorithm. Program contains only 10 product spaces.

# Future Works :

* Program will be able to read and write to specific database

* More memory will be able to be allocated.

* OOP Approach and some Data Structures things will be applied (Linked List, Quicksort etc...)
